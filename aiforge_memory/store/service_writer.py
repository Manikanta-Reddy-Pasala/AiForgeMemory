"""Cypher writer for Service nodes + OWNS_SERVICE/CONTAINS_FILE edges.

Public surface:
    upsert_services(driver, *, repo, services) -> dict counts

Pre-condition: a (:Repo {name: repo}) exists (Stage 2 ran).

Idempotent: MERGE on (Service.repo, Service.name); MERGE edges.
File nodes are placeholders here — they're created with only
(repo, path) keys so that Stage 4 (plan 3) can later fill in
hash, lang, lines, summary, ... without changing identity.

Stale CONTAINS_FILE edges are removed (i.e. if a re-ingest moves
a file out of a service, the old edge is dropped). Stale Service
nodes for the repo (services that disappeared) are deleted along
with their OWNS_SERVICE edges.
