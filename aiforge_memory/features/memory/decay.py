"""Memory decay — archive stale, never-reused facts.

Ported from AIForgeCrew's ``aiforge_core.memory.decay._decay_afm`` so
the scheduler daemon (and ``aiforge-memory decay``) own the job instead
of an external cron.

Rule (KISS): archive ``Observation_v2`` / ``Decision_v2`` nodes where
- ``status`` is null or ``'active'``
- ``seen_count`` ≤ 1 — emitted once, never re-hit by the (repo, text)
  dedupe path; strong signal it wasn't reused
- ``created_at`` older than ``max_age_days``
- ``last_seen_at`` is null OR older than ``max_age_days`` too — a fact
  bumped recently survives even if its creation timestamp is ancient

Archived ≠ deleted: ``status='archived'`` + ``archived_at`` stamp, so
recall (which keeps ``status IS NULL OR status = 'active'``) drops it
but the node stays recoverable.

Env:
    AIFORGE_DECAY_BATCH=500   per-transaction cap (avoids long Cypher tx)
