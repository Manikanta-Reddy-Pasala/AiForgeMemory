"""LSP-driven symbol resolution.

Architecture:
    client.LspClient        — minimal stdio JSON-RPC client.
    adapters.adapter_for    — picks a server command per language.
    resolver.resolve_calls  — high-confidence CALLS via textDocument/references.

Opt-in: enable via `aiforge-memory ingest --lsp`. When the chosen
language server is not installed, the resolver returns an empty list and
the existing tree-sitter heuristic remains the source of truth.
